## ➤ What this App can do?

This app allows users to search for movies by title and displays the results with relevant details such as movie poster, title, release year, and a brief summary. Users can click on a movie to view more detailed information, such as the movie's rating, genre, cast, and reviews.

Some of the key features of this app include:

- **Real-time search:** Search results are updated dynamically as the user types in the search query, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.

- **Responsive design:** The app is designed to be fully responsive on all devices, from mobile to desktop, to provide an optimal viewing experience.

- **Pagination:** The search results are paginated to improve performance and reduce the load time of the app.

- **State management:** The app uses Redux to manage the application's state, providing a predictable and scalable way to handle complex application logic.

- **Third-party API integration:** The app integrates with the OMDb API to retrieve movie data, including posters, titles, ratings, and reviews.

Overall, this app provides an easy-to-use and intuitive interface for searching movies, and can be used as a starting point for building more advanced movie-related applications.
